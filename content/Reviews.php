<h1>Reviews of Charlotte's Healing Hands</h1>

<blockquote>
I have had the opportunity to work with Charlotte for many years now. Every session together is an opportunity for me to learn from her depth of wisdom about the workings of the human body. She understands that I feel my body is my temple for my soul. She helps me to care for my physical body while allowing me the freedom to have my whole self. When I leave from our sessions I do so with an open heart, clear mind, and honest communication between my emotional and physical state. It is rare to find a practitioner with the capacity to care for the true individual. Charlotte's integrity and strength of presence contribute in making her a master of her craft.

Charlotte's (healing hands) how aptly named!  Her work is simply magical; her spirit is beautiful.  If you find yourself questioning whether or not to come see her...I suggest that you run, not walk to her office.

I experienced such severe menstrual pain to the point where it would keep me from work for up to 2 days every month.  I believe I had Endometriosis and was worried I would have problems conceiving a child.  With Charlotte's help I experience little to no pain at menses and am a happy parent.
I have enjoyed my experience with Charlotte so much I often refer patients to her with menstrual issues, infertility, hormonal dysregulation and urinary incontinence.  Every patient has a great experience and the results are impressive.

I have been going to Charlotte for many years now.  I would best describe her approach to healing the body as an intuitive communication.  She has a unique way of listening to your body and what it needs.  When her instinctive nature meets her clinical knowledge she has the capacity to create the perfect space within your body for healing. The conversation that she engages in with your body allows the muscles, structure and organs to find a place of peaceful release and rest.  Whether you are looking for a simple massage or your being and body are calling for something a bit more, Charlotte and her healing hands are the best place to start.

As a competitive triathlete, I'm well versed in the art of tearing up my muscles and (receiving) massage therapy - both on a very regular basis!  Charlotte's approach, techniques and treatment plans are awesome, and the results are amazing. I've found a massage therapist for life.

<h1>Boosting your immune system through massage therapy</h1>

<p>
Your body's immune system helps you fight off infections and illnesses, and it helps you recover from injuries. When you are under high levels of stress, the immune system may not always work as well as it should. Research among different groups of people in very different situations has shown that massage can increase the immune system's cytotoxic capacity (the activity level of the body's natural 'killer cells') and decrease the number of T cells. The result is an immune system that is working better. Massage doesn't cure ailments, but it has been shown to help the body function better in fighting ailments.

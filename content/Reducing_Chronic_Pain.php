<h1>Reducing or eliminating chronic headaches, neck and low back pains through massage therapy</h1>

<p>
Headaches, chronic neck and back pain can be caused by sudden trauma such as auto accidents (whiplash), sports related activities or from repetitious activities such as working at a computer or doing labor intensive jobs hat require a lot of bending, lifting and reaching. Massage can help by releasing the tight, shortened muscles and trigger points. When the muscles relax and become more pliable, the pressure on the nerve lessens and blood circulation improves. By increasing oxygen and blood to the tissue, the pain is reduced and often eliminated.

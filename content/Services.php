<h2 id="Abdominal">The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy</h2>
<p>
  This time honored abdominal therapy is a slow, deep, external (non-invasive) massage treatment for the abdomen, lower back
  and hips. This massage benefits both men and women and is known to be highly effective for fertility, and digestive issues,
  hormonal imbalance and a wide variety of common female symptoms. </p>
<p>
  The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy addresses the position and health of the pelvic and abdominal organs. It
  works to soften the musculature, adjust the uterus to its optimal position in the abdominal cavity and release muscular
  armoring in the trunk, which can improve circulation of blood, lymphatic fluid, nerve impulses and qi in this vital area
  of the body. Visit
  <a href="http://arvigotherapy.com" target="_blank" title="Arvigo Massage - this will open in a new window">Arvigo Therapy</a> for more information. </p>
<p>
  The first session for the abdominal work is 2hrs. Follow-up sessions are 1.5hrs.

<h2 id="Cranio">Craniosacral Therapy</h2>
<p>What does a craniosacral session look like?</p>
<p>
  My job as a craniosacral therapist is to tune in and deeply listen to what your needs are during a session. Craniosacral
  work follows the adage that the body has the innate ability to heal itself if given the ideal situation in which to do
  so. My job as a therapist is to hold space for that to unfold in a way that feels gentle and safe to my clients. I assess
  and release restrictions in the nervous system that have developed either due to physical, emotional or spiritual distress.

<h2 id="clinical">Customized Pain Relief</h2>
<p>
  A structurally oriented massage with the goal of alleviating chronic or acute pain and tension, relax muscle spasms and correct
  postural problems. When the body is in proper alignment it becomes more resilient, less prone to injury and illness. This
  type of massage is personalized to address your individual needs. Techniques include Myofascial Release, Triggerpoint Therapy,
  Post-isometric stretching and Swedish Massage. Charlotte's approach to Pain Relief is often much more gentle than the typical
  deep tissue massage. She is capable of working with the tissue in a way that they body views as being non-invasive. Read

<h2 id="relaxation">Customized Relaxation Massage</h2>
<p>
  This is certainly not your typical relaxation massage. Yes, you are likely to drift off to sleep or some other altered state
  of consciousness, but my intention is always based on alignment. I take into consideration muscle imbalances and do work
  on gently releasing muscles while you float off to relaxation. Not only is this treatment relaxing it also works to enhance
  your body's overall vitality. I am capable of feeling blockages of energy along meridian lines and any other areas of stagnation.
  I then work to gently open up the tissue space around those blockages to allow for unrestricted flow of vital energy. The
  end result is ultimate relaxation!

<h2 id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Massage</h2>
<p>
  Charlotte uses techniques that she has learned from The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy to gently encourage optimal
  uterine position, strengthen the uterus, and promote sufficient blood supply to provide nutrients and oxygen to the uterus/baby
  and to remove toxins. This works to prevent many discomforts of pregnancy and increases the chances of an efficient labor
  and delivery.
</p>
<p>
  The hormones of pregnancy are a result of interactions between the fetus, the placenta and the pregnant woman's body. The
  maternal blood stream provides precursor components to hormones. The synthesis of hormones requires clear circulation in
  the arterial, venous, and lymph systems as well as proper pelvic nerve function, and the flow of chi.
</p>
<p>
  This technique relieves blockages to improve the flow of chi and fluids of the circulatory, lymphatic and nervous systems.
  It can also ease the pain from the normal stretching of the round ligament during pregnancy. These spasms can be much worse
  if there is pressure on one side from a tilted uterus.
</p>
<p>
  The upper abdominal part of the massage can help prevent heartburn and indigestion by opening the diaphragm and promoting
  circulation. Maya Abdominal Massage also relaxes and strengthens the abdominal muscles that will be called into service
  during delivery to assist in giving birth to the baby.

  or Chakras. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that
  include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Reiki is a very calm, gentle and soothing approach to
  help the mind, body and spirit to work together in harmony.

<h2 id="Castor">Castor Oil Packs</h2>

<p>
  <strong> How does Castor oil work?</strong>
</p>
<p> Research has shown that castor oil has a unique chemical profile rich in ricinoleic acid, which is known to exist in nature
  only in castor oil. Double blind studies conducted by the Association for Research and Enlightenment, Inc. demonstrated
  an increase in lymphocyte production and the level of activity of T-cell lymphocytes in the group that used castor oil
  packs. T-cell lymphocytes originate from bone marrow and the thymus gland, identify and kill invaders such as virus, bacteria,
  and fungi. In addition to strengthening the immune system, castor oil appears to have a balancing effect on the autonomic
  nervous system, increasing liver activity and improving digestion. Some of the numerous uses of castor oil include the
  treatment of breast cysts, fibroids, ovarian cysts, congestion of abdominal organs, skin conditions, small benign cysts,
  and adhesions from surgery. Wherever there is congestion, decreased blood flow and need for healing, castor oil can be
  an effective treatment option.

<h2 id="Biomat">Biomat Healing Sessions</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Improve your health and heal your body while you relax in soothing heat.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Designed to ease stress and pain and improve long-term health, the BioMat is a "pad" which lies on top of a massage table
  to convert electricity through a computerized control panel, into Far Infrared Rays (FIR), nature’s invisible light.
</p>

<p>FIR was discovered by NASA to be the safest, most beneficial light wave for the body. It helps reduce swelling, increase
  blood flow, has been shown to destroy cancer and viral cells without harming surrounding healthy cells. It penetrates 6
  to 8 inches into the innermost recesses of the body, stimulating the healing and regeneration of nerves and muscle tissue
  layers.</p>

<p>The negative ions emitted by the BioMat are considered the "Master Power Switch" which activate the body's entire cellular
  communication system and make every body function work better. The amethyst crystals in the upper layer of the mat are
  found to offer the steadiest and most powerful delivery of healthy far infrared light waves.</p>

<p>Using the amethyst BioMat regularly, even for just a short amount of time, delivers a range of health improvements. It helps
  to improve your antioxidant levels, keeps your joints and muscles supple and well conditioned, and leaves your body and
  mind relaxed and refreshed.</p>

<p>Sessions take place in a private tranquil setting on a massage table. You should dress comfortably.</p>

<h2 id="munay">Munay-Ki</h2>

<p>The Munay-Ki are the nine rites of initiation to become a person of wisdom and power who has accepted stewardship for all
  creation. The nine rites are common to all shamanic traditions, even though they are expressed in different forms and styles
  in different cultures. They derive from the great initiations from the Hindus Valley that were brought to the Americas
  by the first medicine men and women who crossed the Baring Straits from Siberia during the glacial period some 30,000 years
  ago. Charlotte can gift these rites at the beginning or end of any bodywork, energy work or spiritual healing session.
  You can also set up a time to do just a Munay-Ki rite. They take about 10-20 minutes each. The rites are given as gifts,
  but a donation or gift may be accepted. To read more about these rites

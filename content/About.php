    From a very young age I recall being aware of a desire to help people. By the ripe age of seven I could be found massaging
    my father's back for a upwards of an hour. Massage has always felt natural and comfortable for me, but I never considered
    it as a career until after some real world life experience. I grew up with a strong medical background - my mother a
    registered nurse and my father an orthodontist. The knowledge and experience that I have gained through my studies with
    The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy, Craniosacral work, Maya Spiritual Healing and Clinical massage is the
    culmination of my life-long passion.

    of Maya Abdominal Therapy .

    I have been enjoying being a teacher since 2007 when I first started co-teaching the clinical program at Texas Healing Arts
    Institute. After become certified as a Self-Care Instructor through the Arvigo Institute, I came to the realization that
    I prefer teaching workshops! Co-teaching is such a beautiful way to share knowledge that is so dear to my heart. I have
    been co-teaching Self-Care workshops for the abdomen since 2011. This past summer Hayley Merchant and I started developing
    our own workshops which are sure to stimulate the Physical, Emotional, Spiritual, Energetic and Mental bodies. Check
    out my events page for our latest offerings!

    I am also a Reiki Master and have been incorporating Reiki into my massage sessions for over 8 years. My combined experience
    and knowledge of the body's anatomy, physiology and energetics help me to work with both the musculoskeletal system and
    the internal organs to bring the body into alignment. My approach to healing can be surprisingly gentle. I can feel where
    there are energetic blockages in the physical body and work on opening up the tissue space around those blockages so
    that energy can flow more easily throughout the body. This is an effective tool that I incorporates into every session.
    I continually strive to broaden my understanding of the body's structure and ability of movement through the practice
    of yoga and receiving Alexander Technique session.

    Over the past couple of years I have been studying Craniosacral Therapy and it has been integrating easily into my practice.
    This work has honestly helped me comprehend what my intuition has already been guiding me to do in sessions. I feel like
    now I have a stronger basis from which to explain to people what is taking place during a session. Please check out my
    services page to learn more about what to expect during a Craniosacral session.

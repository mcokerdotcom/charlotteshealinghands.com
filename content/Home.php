<h1>Charlotte's Healing Hands</h1>

<p>
    Clients are often referred to me from their Chiropractors, Acupuncturists, Naturopaths, friends and family and they often
    have no idea what to expect from a treatment from me. This is perfectly reasonable because anyone that has had a session
    with me knows that their session was completely unique to their own specific needs on that particular day.</p>

    I specialize in The Arvigo Techniques of
    <a href="/services#Abdominal">Maya Abdominal Therapy</a>,
    <a href="/services#Cranio">Craniosacral Therapy</a>, and
    <a href="/services#clinical">customized pain relief sessions</a>. The core belief in my entire practice is that the body naturally wants to heal itself
    and my job is to help create the space for that healing to occur. I work to bring the body into alignment through time-honored
    massage techniques that are tailored for individual needs, while incorporating Craniosacral Therapy, Maya Spiritual Healing
    and Reiki to be able to address emotional and spiritual blocks.

    You may ask, what are The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy? It is a time-honored, non-invasive, external massage
    technique that guides internal abdominal organs into their proper position. Maya massage improves organ function by releasing
    physical and emotional congestion from the abdomen. This massage benefits both men and women and is known to be highly
    effective for fertility, digestive issues, hormonal imbalance and a wide variety of common female symptoms. (Read more

    I was surprised to find out how many different approaches there are to Craniosacral Therapy. After doing some personal exploration
    and self-healing, I identify most with the visionary approach taught by Hugh Milne. The visionary school encompasses
    all ways of understanding and working with the craniosacral system - biodynamic, energetic, mechanical and visionary.
    I like to describe this method of working as shamanism meets craniosacral work. I find it to be quite profound and enjoy
    incorporating aspects of this work into all of my sessions.

<p>
    My experience learning and teaching clinical massage has led me to offer my own variation that I call Customized Pain Relief.
    I combine clinical techniques such as Trigger Point Therapy and Myofascial Release with relaxation and energetic techniques.
    Through these varied massage techniques, I provide a holistic approach for overall alignment of the body and can address
    specific pain complaints. I take into consideration any previous injuries as well as your daily activities in order to
    determine a suitable treatment plan. Together we can develop a proper self-care routine to help you not only attain,
    but maintain a pain free state of wellbeing.
